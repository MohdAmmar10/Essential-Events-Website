        Tesla CEO Elon Musk took the stage on November 21st to unveil the Cybertruck, Tesla’s all-electric 
        pickup truck and the automaker’s sixth vehicle since its founding in 2003.
 Musk unveiled the truck at a cyberpunk-inspired event 
 with many, many lasers and even a surprise ATV. We  managed the event sucessfully.
 Event planning requires foresight, follow through and attention to detail. You need to see 
 the big picture as well as the tiniest of details. You need Vision. Which is why we started Essential
 Event Management. We wanted to create a company with the experience, skills and knowledge to help any
  event, no matter how large or how small, fulfill its ultimate potential. We can help fledgling events
   get off the ground and existing events soar. We’re flexible, fast, responsive and reliable. And we 
   always bring a fresh perspective. No matter what stage of the planning you’re in, we’d welcome the 
   opportunity to help you make your event the best it can be.
